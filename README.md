# Carbon Emission Drivers

Welcome to the carbon-emission-drivers repository! This project is aimed at understanding how financial factors affect a company's carbon emissions on 3 levels - Scope 1 emissions, Scope 2 Location emissions, Scope 3 Market emissions using PanelOLS Regression. This README file will guide you through the process of setting up and running the project on your local machine.

## Pre-requisites
- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: python.org.

- **Package Manager**: Install a package manager like pip or conda. Pip is the default package manager for Python and is usually pre-installed with Python. Conda is an alternative package manager that is often used for managing Python environments. You can install conda by downloading Anaconda or Miniconda from their respective websites.

- **Virtual Environment** (optional): It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for your Python project. Virtual environments allow you to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects. You can create a virtual environment using tools like venv, virtualenv, or conda.
